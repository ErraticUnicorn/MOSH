#title Food Fight!

Accepted the Librarian's plea to rescue her student Phil from the dangerous cafeteria. Head over ASAP!

#if Progress1 and not Progress2
Reached Phil... now head out of the cafeteria!
#end

#if Progress2
Braved flying apples and burgers to reach Phil, who followed you back out of the cafeteria. She seems unrattled by the whole incident.
#end

#if Complete
Reported back to the Librarian, who showered you with praise. Few are the people who would navigate a food fight to rescue a nerd.
