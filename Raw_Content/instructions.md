Raw Content Folder

This is for art and content people. XNA requires special file types for assets in the game, and converting stuff to the appropriate format is a bit tricky.

So, just drop all your content in here (in .jpg, .png, .wav, or other formats) and we'll convert it. Compressed music is a bit tricky at the moment.
